# Create ASGI Falcon App
modbus_ws_resource = ModbusWebSocketResource()
app = falcon.asgi.App()

# Add the WebSocket resource to the Falcon application
# Falcon uses add_route for all routes, including WebSockets.
# The `on_websocket` method will be automatically called when a WS connection is made.
app.add_route("/ws", modbus_ws_resource)

# Note: The middleware for starting polling is no longer strictly necessary
# as we initiate polling when the first WebSocket client connects in
# ModbusWebSocketResource.on_websocket. If you want polling to start immediately
# when the server launches, regardless of WebSocket connections, you can keep
# a similar middleware, but it needs to interact with the resource instance.
# However, for this specific use case (Modbus data via WebSocket), starting
# polling on first connection is often more efficient.

# To start polling immediately on app startup (alternative to starting on first WS connection):
# @falcon.asgi.middleware
# class ModbusStartupMiddleware:
#     def __init__(self, app):
#         self.app = app
#
#     async def process_request(self, req, resp, resource, params):
#         # This runs for every request, which isn't ideal for a single startup task.
#         # It's better to manage background tasks outside of per-request middleware.
#         pass
#
#     async def process_response(self, req, resp, resource, req_succeeded):
#         # This runs after the response
#         pass

# A cleaner way for app-wide background tasks in Falcon, if you don't want to start on first connection:
# You'd typically manage this with the uvicorn.run's on_startup or similar event hooks
# or within your main script if you're not using a specific ASGI server's lifecycle hooks.
# For simplicity and directly tying to the WebSocket, the current implementation in
# ModbusWebSocketResource.on_websocket is good.

# Start server using python3 main.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Ensure this file is saved as `main.py` if you use "main:app"
    # Or, if your file is `modbus.py`, change to "modbus:app"
